The TouchGFX framework, written in C++, allows you to create modern, graphical user interfaces on limited-resource embedded systems and allows smartphone-like look and feel on hardware platforms an order of magnitude less powerful than smartphones, e.g. ARM Cortex M3-M4 48-204 MHz.

This repository will contain examples of widgets, containers and mixins that cannot be found in the core framework (See documentation link below) that can be used as a source of inspiration for your applications but  will not be maintained across new versions of the framework. Contributions are encouraged!

On the TouchGFX website you can request a full evaluation version of the framework as well as order commercial licenses. 

Read more about the concept of widgets, containers and mixins in  in the TouchGFX [documentation](http://touchgfx.com/documentation/html/index.html).
